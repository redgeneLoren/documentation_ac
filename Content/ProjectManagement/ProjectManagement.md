The <b>dashboard</b> serves as the `homepage` in the `AC Tajanlangit System`. This is where you will be able to view all the listed functions for the development of a project. 

Here are the different sections in the application:

### I. Header Section

The header section is located at the top most of the dashboard. It contains the <strong>`ACT logo`</strong> on the left side of the header, the <strong>`Project Name`</strong> at the center of the header and the <strong>`Icon Controllers`</strong> on the right side of the header.

## <ins>Creating a Project - Admin Role</ins>

Once planning of a project is complete, the assigned `admin` will begin to create a project. In creating a project in the application, the user is required to be assigned under an <b>`admin role`</b>.

In this section we will start to create a new project using the `AC Tajanlangit System`.

- On the upper right hand corner of the dashboard, you will see 6 different icons. 

- Click the <b>`Create Project / Switch Project icon`</b> <img src="images/NewProject_SwitchProject.jpg" height="20px"> on the upper right part of the dashboard to `create a new project`. The icon looks like an unopened folder with a star character inside the folder.
