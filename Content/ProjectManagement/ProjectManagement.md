The <b>dashboard</b> serves as the `homepage` in the `AC Tajanlangit System`. This is where you will be able to view all the listed functions for the development of a project. 

Here are the different sections in the application:

### I. Header Section

The header section is located at the top most of the dashboard. It contains the <strong>`ACT logo`</strong> on the left side of the header, the <strong>`Project Name`</strong> at the center of the header and the <strong>`Icon Controllers`</strong> on the right side of the header.

## <ins>Creating a Project - Admin Role</ins>

Once planning of a project is complete, the assigned `admin` will begin to create a project using the `AC Tajanlangit System` to put in to details the project. In creating a project in the application, the user is required to be assigned under an <b>`admin role`</b>, if the user is not assigned as an admin, the user is unable to create a new project.

To be assigned to an `admin role`, contact your appointed admin in order to get credentials for an `admin role`.

In this section we will start to create a new project as an `admin` using the `AC Tajanlangit System`. In creating a project there are two scenarios, First scenario is `creating a project for the first time` and the second scenario is `creating a project with an existing project`. 

### <strong>I. Creating your first Project</strong>

If this is the first time a project is to be created this would be the steps in creating a new project.

- After you log in using an <strong>`admin role`</strong> credential a pop up window will appear. The pop up window is labeled as `Create New Project`.

The `Create New Project` have three steps in order to successfully create a new project.
